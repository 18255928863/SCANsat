		#autoLOC_SCANsat_Radar = SCAN brings you this high performance RADAR altimetry sensor. This is the entry-level model in this sensor family, and commonly sold in a bundle with toy rockets and remote-controlled model planes. After focus group testing revealed that 95% of the target audience tried to duct tape it to the exhaust pipe of their rocket engines, this new and improved model has been made even easier to use.
		#autoLOC_SCANsat_Multi = This multichannel sensor detects radiation across several infrared, visible light, and RADAR bands. This gives it the capability to differentiate between terrain types and biomes. It can also detect anomalies such as structures on the ground.
		#autoLOC_SCANsat_SAR = This Synthetic Aperture RADAR sensor uses its flight path to simulate a much larger antenna. This makes it possible to detect terrain elevation at much higher resolution. The downside is that its field of view is comparatively small, and it works better at higher altitudes.
		#autoLOC_SCANsat_BTDT = This small sensor can automatically identify nearby anomalies. Since it only works over very short distances and at very low altitudes, it's primarily useful to track identified anomalies that have been visited.
