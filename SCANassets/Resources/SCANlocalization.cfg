			settingsHelpAnomalies = Select the marker used to display\nanomalies on the map.
			settingsHelpScanningToggle = Toggle all SCANsat scanning.
			settingsHelpBackground = Toggle background scanning on\nselected celestial bodies.
			settingsHelpTimeWarp = Adjust the scanning frequency during TimeWarp.\nHigher settings result in fewer gaps in the maps\nbut may have a performance impact at high TimeWarp.
			settingsHelpGroundTracks = Display a visible indicator of\nscanning activity in map mode.
			settingsHelpGroundTracksActive = The ground track indicator can be limited\nto only be displayed for the active vessel.
			settingsHelpStockUIStyle = Switch between stock KSP-style UI elements and Unity-style elements.
			settingsHelpOverlayTooltips = Displays tooltips for the current mouse position when a planetary overlay map is activated.\nThese tooltips include The cursor coordinates, terrain height, slope, biome name,\nand resource abundance, depending on scanning coverage.
			settingsHelpWindowTooltips = Display tooltips on some map window buttons.\nThese are primarily used to identify icon buttons.
			settingsHelpStockToolbar = Use the stock toolbar.\nCan be used concurrently with the Blizzy78 Toolbar.
			settingsHelpToolbarMenu = Use a pop-out menu for the stock toolbar to show all available windows.
			settingsHelpMechJeb = The SCANsat zoom map target selection mode can be used to select a MechJeb landing site.
			settingsHelpResetWindows = Reset all window positions and scale.\nUse this in case a window has been dragged completely\noff screen or if any windows are not visible.
			settingsHelpResetPlanetData = Resets all SCANsat data for the current celestial body.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			settingsHelpResetAllData = Resets all SCANsat data for all celestial bodies.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			settingsHelpVesselsSensorsPasses = Information about the currently active SCANsat sensors.\nVessels indicates the number of vessels with active sensors.\nSensors indicates the total number of sensors;\ninstruments with multiple sensor types count each individual sensor.\nPasses indicates the number of sensor updates performed per second.\nThis value is affected by the TimeWarp Resolution setting.
			settingsHelpGreyScale = Use a true grey-scale color spectrum for black-and-white SCANsat maps.\nPixels on the altitude map will interpolate between black and white;\nthe min and max terrain heights for each celestial body define the limits.
			settingsHelpExportCSV = Export a .csv file along with map texture when using the Export button on the big map.\nThe file contains coordinates and the terrain height for each pixel.\nPixels are labeled from left to right and from top to bottom.
			settingsHelpSetMapWidth = Enter an exact value for the SCANsat big map texture width.\nValues are limited to 550 - 8192 pixels wide.\nPress the Set button to apply the value.
			settingsHelpWindowScale = Adjust all SCANsat window scales.
			settingsHelpFillPlanet = Fill in all SCANsat data for the current celestial body.
			settingsHelpFillAll = Fill in all SCANsat data for all celestial bodies.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayWindow = Open the planetary overlay map control window.
			resourceSettingsHelpBiomeLock = Circumvents the requirement for stock surface biome scans.\nSCANsat displays will show the full accuracy for resource\nabundance with or without any surface biome scans.
			resourceSettingsHelpInstant = By default, the stock M700 resource scanner's orbital survey will fill in all SCANsat resource maps.\nThis can be disabled, requiring standard SCANsat methods for all resource scanning.\nDisabled automatically when stock resource scanning is disabled.
			resourceSettingsHelpNarrowBand = Numerous SCANsat functions require a Narrow-Band resource scanner on-board\nthe current vessel or in orbit of a celestial body for fully accurate resource abundance data.\nDisable this to circumvent these restrictions.
			resourceSettingsHelpDisableStock = Disables all stock resource scanning functions.\nSCANsat scanning methods will be required for all resource data.\nReplaces several stock resource functions with SCANsat tools.\nThese include The right-click readouts, and the planetary overlay maps.
			resourceSettingsHelpResetSCANsatResource = Resets all SCANsat resource data for the current celestial body. Other SCANsat data is not affected.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			resourceSettingsHelpResetStockResource = Resets the stock resource scanning coverage for the current celestial body.\nA reload or scene change may be required for all changes to take effect.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayInterpolation = Change the number of resource abundance measurements used in constructing\nthe planetary overlay and big map resource overlay.\nDecrease the value to increase the accuracy of the map.\nLower values will result in slower map generation.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayHeight = Change the texture size (map width is 2XHeight) used in constructing\nthe planetary overlay and big map resource overlay.\nIncrease the value to increase the quality and accuracy of the map.\nHigher values will result in slower map generation.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayBiomeHeight = Change the texture size (map width is 2XHeight) used in constructing\nthe planetary overlay biome map. Increase the value to increase\nthe quality and accuracy of the map.\nHigher values will result in slower map generation.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayTransparency = Create a grey background for planetary overlay resource maps.\nUsed to make clear which sections of the celestial body\nhave been scanned but contain no resources.
			resourceSettingsHelpScanThreshold = A threshold level used to apply the stock resource scan to a celestial body after scanning with SCANsat sensors.\nThis is useful when contracts or other addons require that a stock resource scan be performed.\nSet a value from 0-100 in the text box and click on the Set button.\nAll celestial bodies will be checked immediately; celestial bodies will also be checked upon loading or a scene change.\nA reload may be required for the changes to take effect.
			resourceSettingsModuleManagerWarning = Warning:\nModule Manager is required for all SCANsat resource scanning
			colorTerrainHelpMin = Defines the low altitude cutoff for the terrain color palette. Anything below this altitude will be shown with the lowest color.
			colorTerrainHelpMax = Defines the high altitude cutoff for the terrain color palette. Anything above this altitude will be shown with the highest color.
			colorTerrainHelpClampToggle = Used to define a cutoff between the low and high altitude values. This is particularly useful for ocean planets where it helps to define a sharp distinction between land and ocean.
			colorTerrainHelpClamp = Defines the clamp altitude cutoff. Anything below the cutoff will be represented by the first two colors in the selected color palette. Anything above the cutoff will be represented with the remaining colors.
			colorTerrainHelpReverse = Reverses the order of the currently\nselected color palette.
			colorTerrainHelpDiscrete = Draws the map using only the specific colors defined by each palette, instead of smoothly interpolating between them.
			colorTerrainHelpPaletteSize = Adjust the number of colors available in the currently selected color palette.
			colorBiomeHelpStock = Use the stock biome color scheme for\nSCANsat biome maps.
			colorBiomeHelpWhiteBorder = Draw a white border between biomes. Does not apply to the planetary overlay biome maps.
			colorBiomeHelpTransparency = Adjust the transparency of biome maps. Terrain elevation is shown behind the biome maps. Set to 0% to disable terrain drawing.
			colorPickerHelpLow = The top color swatch shows the updated color selection for the low end of this color spectrum. The bottom color swatch shows the currently active color.
			colorPickerHelpHigh = The top color swatch shows the updated color selection for the high end of this color spectrum. The bottom color swatch shows the currently active color.
			colorPickerHelpValue = This slider adjusts the Value (in HSV color terms) or Brightness for the currently selected color.
			colorResourceHelpFineControl = Activates Fine Control Mode where the sliders will only show values within 5% of the current selection.
			colorResourceHelpMin = The low cutoff for resource concentration on the selected celestial body. Resource deposits at this level will be displayed using the low end of the current resource overlay color spectrum. Resource deposits below this value will not be shown.
			colorResourceHelpMax = The high cutoff for resource concentration on the selected celestial body. Resource deposits above this value will be shown using the high end of the current resource overlay color spectrum.
			colorResourceHelpTransparency = Defines the level of transparency for resource overlays. Increase to allow more of the underlying terrain, slope, or biome map to be visible. This also affect the transparency of resource deposits on the planetary overlay resource map.
			colorResourceHelpApply = Applies the current values for the selected resource and celestial body only.
			colorResourceHelpApplyAll = Applies the current values for the selected resource for all celestial bodies.
			colorResourceHelpDefault = Reverts to the default values for the selected resource and celestial body only.
			colorResourceHelpDefaultAll = Reverts to the default values for the selected resource for all celestial bodies.
			colorHelpSaveToConfig = Save all color configuration values to the config file found in your SCANsat/Resources folder. These values serve as the defaults for new saves and for all Revert To Default buttons. Values do not need to be saved to the config file to be applied for this save file.
			colorSlopeHelpCutoff = Adjust the cutoff level between the two selected slope color pairs.
