			settingsHelpGroundTracksActive = The ground track indicator can be limited\nto only be displayed for the active vessel.
			settingsHelpStockUIStyle = Switch between stock KSP-style UI elements and Unity-style elements.
			settingsHelpOverlayTooltips = Displays tooltips for the current mouse position when a planetary overlay map is activated.\nThese tooltips include The cursor coordinates, terrain height, slope, biome name,\nand resource abundance, depending on scanning coverage.
			settingsHelpWindowTooltips = Display tooltips on some map window buttons.\nThese are primarily used to identify icon buttons.

			settingsHelpMapGenSpeed = Adjust all SCANsat map generation speeds.\nLower values will save CPU resources and may reduce the\nperformance impact of generating maps.
			settingsHelpResetWindows = Reset all window positions and scale.\nUse this in case a window has been dragged completely\noff screen or if any windows are not visible.
			settingsHelpResetPlanetData = Resets all SCANsat data for the current celestial body.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			settingsHelpResetAllData = Resets all SCANsat data for all celestial bodies.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.

			resourceSettingsHelpInstant = By default, the stock M700 resource scanner's orbital survey will fill in all SCANsat resource maps.\nThis can be disabled, requiring standard SCANsat methods for all resource scanning.\nDisabled automatically when stock resource scanning is disabled.
			resourceSettingsHelpNarrowBand = Numerous SCANsat functions require a Narrow-Band resource scanner on-board\nthe current vessel or in orbit of a celestial body for fully accurate resource abundance data.\nDisable this to circumvent these restrictions.
			resourceSettingsHelpDisableStock = Disables all stock resource scanning functions.\nSCANsat scanning methods will be required for all resource data.\nReplaces several stock resource functions with SCANsat tools.\nThese include The right-click readouts, and the planetary overlay maps.
			resourceSettingsHelpResetSCANsatResource = Resets all SCANsat resource data for the current celestial body.\nOther SCANsat data is not affected.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			resourceSettingsHelpResetStockResource = Resets the stock resource scanning coverage for the current celestial body.\nA reload or scene change may be required for all changes to take effect.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayInterpolation = Change the number of resource abundance measurements used in constructing\nthe planetary overlay and big map resource overlay.\nDecrease the value to increase the accuracy of the map.\nLower values will result in slower map generation.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayHeight = Change the texture size (map width is 2XHeight) used in constructing\nthe planetary overlay and big map resource overlay.\nIncrease the value to increase the quality and accuracy of the map.\nHigher values will result in slower map generation.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayBiomeHeight = Change the texture size (map width is 2XHeight) used in constructing\nthe planetary overlay biome map. Increase the value to increase\nthe quality and accuracy of the map.\nHigher values will result in slower map generation.
			resourceSettingsHelpOverlayTransparency = Create a grey background for planetary overlay resource maps.\nUsed to make clear which sections of the celestial body\nhave been scanned but contain no resources.
			resourceSettingsHelpScanThreshold = A threshold level used to apply the stock resource scan to a celestial body after scanning with SCANsat sensors.\nThis is useful when contracts or other addons require that a stock resource scan be performed.\nSet a value from 0-100 in the text box and click on the Set button.\nAll celestial bodies will be checked immediately;\ncelestial bodies will also be checked upon loading or a scene change.\nA reload may be required for the changes to take effect.
			colorTerrainHelpMin = Defines the low altitude cutoff for the terrain color palette.\nAnything below this altitude will be shown with the lowest color.
			colorTerrainHelpMax = Defines the high altitude cutoff for the terrain color palette.\nAnything above this altitude will be shown with the highest color.
			colorTerrainHelpClampToggle = Used to define a cutoff between the low and high altitude values.\nThis is particularly useful for ocean planets where it helps to\ndefine a sharp distinction between land and ocean.
			colorTerrainHelpClamp = Defines the clamp altitude cutoff.\nAnything below the cutoff will be represented by the first two colors in the selected color palette.\nAnything above the cutoff will be represented with the remaining colors.

			colorPickerHelpHigh = The top color swatch shows the updated\ncolor selection for the high end of this color spectrum.\nThe bottom color swatch shows the currently active color.
			colorResourceHelpMin = The low cutoff for resource concentration on the selected celestial body.\nResource deposits at this level will be displayed\nusing the low end of the current resource overlay color spectrum.\nResource deposits below this value will not be shown.
			colorResourceHelpMax = The high cutoff for resource concentration on the selected celestial body.\nResource deposits above this value will be displayed\nusing the high end of the current resource overlay color spectrum.
			colorResourceHelpTransparency = Defines the level of transparency for resource overlays.\nIncrease to allow more of the underlying terrain, slope, or biome map to be visible.\nThis also affect the transparency of resource deposits on the planetary overlay resource map.
			colorResourceHelpApply = Applies the current values for the\nselected resource and celestial body only.
			colorResourceHelpApplyAll = Applies the current values for the\nselected resource for all celestial bodies.
